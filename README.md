# Google-Books-Search

## Introduction
This is a React application. From the Search page Users can search for any book, save it or Users can go view more about the book when they click on "view". From the Saved page users can view all their saved books and delete them if they want. I was having issues getting the api to work on heroku, the page would come up but I couldn't search for a book. So a scrapped a lot of things and created a new heroku page and deployed to that one (see below). The save and delete books section are not there and also the heroku site is not working for me anymore. The app does work on localhost and you can search for a book and view more but cannot save or delete.

App built with React, Node, Express and MongoDB
